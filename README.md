# Sales-Dashboard-Design
task 8
	1.	 Imported the Superstore.csv dataset into Tableau to visualize sales performance by month, region, and category.
	2.	 Created three interactive sheets: a line chart for monthly sales trends, a bar chart for regional sales comparison, and a pie chart (or donut chart) for category-wise sales share.
	3.	 Added slicers/filters for Region and Category to enable interactive exploration of the data.
	4.	 Designed a dashboard layout combining all three charts, with visual cues like colors and labels to highlight top-performing segments.
	5.	 Generated insights, such as peak sales months and top-performing regions/categories, and exported the dashboard as an image/PDF for presentation.
